# Monarch Money

Python library for accessing [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/referral/ngam2i643l) data.

# Installation

## From Source Code

Clone this repository from Git

`git clone https://github.com/hammem/monarchmoney.git`

## Via `pip`

`pip install monarchmoney`
# Instantiate & Login

There are two ways to use this library: interactive and non-interactive.

## Interactive

If you're using this library in something like iPython or Jupyter, you can run an interactive-login which supports multi-factor authentication:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.interactive_login()
```
This will prompt you for the email, password and, if needed, the multi-factor token.

## Non-interactive

For a non-interactive session, you'll need to create an instance and login:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.login(email, password)
```

This may throw a `RequireMFAException`.  If it does, you'll need to get a multi-factor token and call the following method:

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
try:
        await mm.login(email, password)
except RequireMFAException:
        await mm.multi_factor_authenticate(email, password, multi_factor_code)
```

Alternatively, you can provide the MFA Secret Key. The MFA Secret Key is found when setting up the MFA in Monarch Money by going to Settings -> Security -> Enable MFA -> and copy the "Two-factor text code". Then provide it in the login() method:
```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
await mm.login(
        email=email,
        password=password,
        save_session=False,
        use_saved_session=False,
        mfa_secret_key=mfa_secret_key,
    )

```

# Use a Saved Session

You can easily save your session for use later on.  While we don't know precisely how long a session lasts, authors of this library have found it can last several months.

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
mm.interactive_login()

# Save it for later, no more need to login!
mm.save_session()
```

Once you've logged in, you can simply load the saved session to pick up where you left off.

```python
from monarchmoney import MonarchMoney, RequireMFAException

mm = MonarchMoney()
mm.load_session()

# Then, start accessing data!
await mm.get_accounts()
```

# FAQ

**How do I use this API if I login to Monarch via Google?**

If you currently use Google or 'Continue with Google' to access your Monarch account, you'll need to set a password to leverage this API.  You can set a password on your Monarch account by going to your [security settings](https://app.monarchmoney.com/settings/security).  

Don't forget to use a password unique to your Monarch account and to enable multi-factor authentication!
